Dentist-Industry Financial Relationship in Massachusetts (2020)


Visiting a dentist is a challenge for many Massachusetts residents, in part due to the cost of care. Financial payments received from drug and device companies may impact clinicians’ decision-making and prescribe. As a critical first step, I examine the dentist-industry financial relationship using the Open Payment datasets. 

The Open Payments Dataset, managed by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, is a national disclosure program of transfers of value between drug and device companies and physicians. While there were existing studies related to physician specialties in dermatology, emergency, neurotology, and psychiatry, there are no studies related to dentistry. Moreover, a total of 5166 payments, summing to $1893633, related to dentistry. Thus, analysis of Open Payment datasets for dentistry is of great importance and can give us better insight into the financial relationship between dental physicians and the industry. 

To be specific, I want to find payments distributed among different dental specialties, the relationship between dentists’ received money and the nature of payment, the association between different months and payments, as well as the financial relationship between the drug companies and the physicians.
